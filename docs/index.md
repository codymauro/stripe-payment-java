This guide helps business owners, new developers, designers, and writers get comfortable integrating **Stripe Checkout** into their applications. You’ll build a simple, one-time $10 payment flow that works end-to-end using Stripe’s prebuilt checkout page.  

**The goal:** Understand how a secure payment moves from button-click to confirmation, without getting lost in setup, full-stack complexity, or Stripe’s 100-plus-page documentation.  
### Stripe Checkout Overview
Stripe Checkout is a hosted payment page that handles card details, validation, and security so you don’t have to manage sensitive data on your own servers. We’ll use Stripe libraries/SDKs for this. The **Software Development Kit (SDK)** gives us pre-written code that makes it easier to connect to Stripe’s API without starting from scratch. That way, we can:

1. Create a checkout session
2. Redirect users to pay
3. Handle the response.

**Total on-hands time**: 5-15 minutes for the basic flow, depending on your comfort with python and terminals.

### Additional Details
This guide uses **JavaScript** (Node/Express) for backend examples. If you prefer working in **Python** (Flask), you can follow the [companion guide here](https://codymauro.github.io/stripe-payment-guide/).

All examples use Stripe’s Sandbox, or testing, mode. No real money changes hands. This keeps things safe while you learn and test. Check the Prerequisites to set up.
